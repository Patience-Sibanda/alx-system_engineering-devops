Duration of Outage:
Start: June 15, 2024, 14:00 UTC
End: June 15, 2024, 16:30 UTC
Impact: The outage affected our main e-commerce website, rendering it completely inaccessible to users. Approximately 85% of our user base experienced downtime, with the remaining 15% reporting significant slowness. Customers were unable to browse products, place orders, or access their accounts.
Root Cause: The root cause was a misconfiguration in the load balancer settings following a routine update, leading to an improper distribution of traffic and overwhelming a single server.
Timeline
14:00 UTC - Issue detected via monitoring alert indicating a spike in error rates and a drop in response times.
14:05 UTC - Engineers began investigating the issue. Initial suspicion fell on a potential DDoS attack.
14:15 UTC - Further analysis ruled out DDoS, shifting focus to server health and network configurations.
14:30 UTC - Misleading investigation path: Checking for recent application code changes for potential bugs.
14:45 UTC - Escalated to the Network and Infrastructure team as no application-level issues were found.
15:00 UTC - Network team identified irregularities in traffic distribution across servers.
15:15 UTC - Discovered recent load balancer configuration change coincided with the start of the outage.
15:30 UTC - Rolled back load balancer configuration to previous stable state.
16:00 UTC - System began to stabilize; user accessibility gradually restored.
16:30 UTC - Full functionality confirmed; outage officially declared over.
Root Cause and Resolution
Root Cause: The outage was caused by an erroneous update to the load balancer configuration. The update included an incorrect rule that directed the majority of incoming traffic to a single server, causing it to become overwhelmed while other servers in the pool remained idle. This resulted in the server reaching its maximum capacity quickly, leading to widespread access issues and slowdowns.
Resolution: Once the Network team identified the misconfiguration, the immediate action was to revert the load balancer settings to the last known good configuration. The rollback corrected the traffic distribution, allowing the overloaded server to recover and traffic to be balanced evenly across all servers. Monitoring systems were then used to ensure that the system returned to normal operating conditions.
Corrective and Preventative Measures
Improvements and Fixes:
Review and Update Change Management Procedures:
Ensure all configuration changes go through a rigorous review process.
Implement a checklist for load balancer updates to avoid misconfigurations.
Enhanced Monitoring:
Add specific alerts for uneven traffic distribution across servers.
Increase granularity of monitoring on load balancers to detect anomalies faster.
Load Balancer Configuration Automation:
Automate the deployment and rollback of load balancer configurations to reduce human error.
Implement automated tests for load balancer configurations before they are applied.
Incident Response Training:
Conduct regular training for the engineering team on identifying and resolving network-related issues.
